This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6 where a catch-all route ('*') interferes with other, more specific routes.  The problem is that the catch-all route will always match if no other route matches, even if a technically correct path is provided. The solution involves carefully ordering routes and potentially using more specific catch-all patterns if absolutely necessary.
